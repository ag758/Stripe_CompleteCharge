# Stripe Complete Charge Script
Written in Ruby, this script interacts with the Stripe API to process payments after tokenization of the customer's payment method (Credit or Debit Card) for additional security. This script is hosted on a Heroku server. The file is "web.rb", which handles http post and get requests.

# Setup
To function correctly, a secret live key from the Stripe dashboard is required to function correctly.
